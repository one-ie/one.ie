## Creating Your First Funnel

### The 5-Stage Conversation Flow

The AI guides you through 5 stages:

#### Stage 1: Discovery (Understanding)

**What the AI asks:**
- What are you selling?
- Who is your target audience?
- What's your main goal? (leads, sales, signups)
- What's your experience level?

**Example conversation:**

```
You: "I want to sell my online course"

AI: "Excellent! I'll help you create a high-converting course funnel.
     First, let me understand your needs:

     1. What's your course about?
     2. Who is your target audience?
     3. What's the price point?
     4. Have you launched courses before?"

You: "Productivity course for entrepreneurs, $497, first launch"
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific about your target audience (age, interests, pain points)
- Mention your price point (helps AI recommend the right template)
- Share your experience level (AI adjusts complexity accordingly)

#### Stage 2: Template Selection (Recommendation)

**What the AI does:**
- Analyzes your answers
- Recommends 2-3 funnel templates
- Explains why each template fits your needs
- Shows expected conversion rates

**Example conversation:**

```
AI: "Perfect! For a $497 course, I recommend:

     1. Product Launch Funnel (RECOMMENDED)
        - Pre-launch buzz building
        - Early bird discount
        - Launch day sales page
        - Expected conversion: 8-12%

     2. Webinar Funnel
        - Free training first
        - Pitch at the end
        - Expected conversion: 5-10%

     3. Simple Sales Page
        - Direct to sales
        - Quick testing
        - Expected conversion: 2-5%

     Which approach sounds best?"

You: "Let's go with Product Launch"
```

**Tips:**
- Read all recommendations before choosing
- Higher conversion rates = better template fit
- Ask questions if you're unsure about a template

#### Stage 3: Customization (Branding)

**What the AI helps with:**
- Funnel name and URL slug
- Brand colors (primary, secondary)
- Logo and imagery
- Tone and voice (professional, casual, urgent)

**Example conversation:**

```
AI: "Great choice! Now let's personalize your funnel.

     1. What should we name your funnel?
     2. What are your brand colors? (hex codes)
     3. What tone works best? (professional/casual/urgent)"

You: "Productivity Mastery Launch, #2563eb and #7c3aed, professional but friendly"

AI: "Perfect! I'll create your funnel with those settings."
```

**Tips:**
- Use hex codes for exact color matching (e.g., #2563eb)
- Choose a memorable funnel name (shows in analytics)
- URL slug should be short and SEO-friendly

#### Stage 4: Build Pages (Step-by-Step)

**What the AI does:**
- Creates each page in your funnel
- Suggests headlines and copy
- Recommends page structure
- Adds conversion elements

**Example conversation:**

```
AI: "Let's build your Coming Soon page:

     Suggested headline:
     'The Productivity System That Helped 10,000+ Entrepreneurs
      Reclaim 20 Hours Per Week'

     Key sections:
     - Countdown timer (14 days until launch)
     - 3 key benefits
     - Email signup form
     - Social proof

     Want me to create this page?"

You: "Yes, create it!"

AI: ✓ Created Coming Soon page!

     Next, let's build your Early Bird Offer page.
     This is where we reward early adopters with a 20% discount..."
```

**Tips:**
- Review AI suggestions before confirming
- You can customize headlines and copy later
- Ask to see previews before publishing

#### Stage 5: Preview & Publish (Launch)

**What the AI helps with:**
- Preview funnel flow
- Add tracking codes (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel)
- Set up payment processing (Stripe)
- Publish and get your live URL

**Example conversation:**

```
AI: "Your funnel is ready for preview:

     Funnel Flow:
     1. Coming Soon → Collect emails
     2. Early Bird → $397 (20% off)
     3. Launch Day → $497 full price
     4. Thank You → Deliver course

     Next steps:
     - Add Stripe for payments?
     - Add Google Analytics tracking?
     - Preview pages before publishing?

     When ready, I'll publish your funnel!"

You: "Add Stripe and publish"
