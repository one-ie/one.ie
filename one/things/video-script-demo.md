# Video Script: ONE Platform Demo
## Frank Kern Framework Applied

### Preparation Notes
- **Desired Outcome:** Get viewers to visit one.ie and start building
- **Benefits:** Free forever, fast deployment, no coding required, enterprise-ready, infinite scale
- **Objections:** "Too good to be true", "Probably limited features", "Will it scale?", "Is it actually free?", "Why free?"

### Frank Kern's Core Framework
1. **"Here's what I got"** - The product/solution (demo the transformation)
2. **"Here's what it'll do for you"** - Benefits and objection handling
3. **"Here's what I want you to do next"** - Clear call to action

---

## Opening Hook (15 seconds)
### "Here's What I Got"

"I'm going to show you how to build and deploy a production-ready e-commerce site in the next 3 minutes.

No coding. No configuration hell. No credit card.

Just plain English, and it's live on Cloudflare's global edge network.

Watch this."

---

## Part 1: DEMO - Show Don't Tell (90 seconds)
### "Here's What I Got" (Continued)

**[SCREEN RECORDING STARTS]**

"I'm going to type in plain English what I want:

```
Create a page selling the top 10 coolest products
I'll buy when I'm a billionaire.

Search the web for:
- Product names and descriptions
- Product images
- Company logos and icons
- Pricing

Build a product gallery page with:
- Hero section
- Product grid with images
- Stripe checkout
- Mobile responsive
- Deploy to Cloudflare
```

**[Show AI processing in real-time]**

The system just:
- Searched the web for billionaire products
- Found images, logos, pricing
- Generated a production-ready page
- Set up Stripe payments
- Deployed to 360 global locations

Time elapsed: 2 minutes.

**[Show live site on desktop and phone]**

This is live. This is production. This loads in under 1 second anywhere in the world.

100% Lighthouse score. Zero configuration."

---

## Part 2: What It'll Do For You (60 seconds)
### "Here's What It'll Do For You"

**Address objections while showing benefits:**

"Now you're probably thinking: 'This can't be free. There's gotta be a catch.'

There's no catch.

**What you get:**
- 100% free forever (not a trial - FOREVER)
- Free Cloudflare hosting (360 global edge locations)
- Free SSL certificates
- Unlimited pages
- Unlimited products
- Sub-second page loads globally
- 100% Google Lighthouse scores
- Production-ready code (Astro 5, React 19, Tailwind v4)

**'But will it scale?'**

It's built on the same infrastructure that handles millions of requests:
- Cloudflare's edge network (the same one protecting Fortune 500 companies)
- Real-time database with Convex
- The 6-dimension ontology that scales from 2 users to 8 billion without refactoring

**'What can I actually build?'**

Anything:
- E-commerce stores (with Stripe, we just showed you)
- Course platforms with enrollments
- SaaS landing pages with pricing tiers
- Community platforms
- AI agent apps
- Blogs, portfolios, documentation sites

All with the same simple approach: describe what you want, paste it in chat, deploy.

**'Is this actually production-ready?'**

The page we just built? That's production code. You could start selling products right now. Just add your real Stripe keys."

---

## Part 3: What I Want You To Do Next (30 seconds)
### "Here's What I Want You To Do Next"

"Here's what I want you to do:

**Step 1:** Go to **one.ie** right now

**Step 2:** Type what you want to build in plain English (just like I showed you)

**Step 3:** Watch it build and deploy

That's it.

No credit card. No trial period. No 'upgrade to unlock features.'

**100% free forever.**

If you want to sell something? Add your Stripe keys and you're live.

If you want AI chat? Tell it to add chat.

If you need it to scale? It already does.

**The only thing standing between you and a live production app is 3 minutes and one.ie**

So go build something."

---

## Part 4: Social Proof & Final Objection Handling (Optional - 20 seconds)

"'Why are you giving this away for free?'

Because the real magic isn't in the code - it's in the 6-dimension ontology underneath.

Once you start building on ONE, you'll realize you can build ANYTHING without changing your schema.

Need to add team features? Same schema.
Want to add courses? Same schema.
Scale to millions of users? Same schema.

We're not giving away the platform to be nice. We're giving it away because once you see how fast you can build with this, you're never going back to the old way.

**one.ie** - go build."

## Video Structure Summary (Frank Kern Framework)

**Total Length:** 3-4 minutes

1. **Hook (15 sec):** "Here's what I got" - Promise to show production deployment in 3 minutes
2. **Demo (90 sec):** "Here's what I got" - SHOW the entire process, no talking about features
3. **Benefits (60 sec):** "Here's what it'll do for you" - Address all objections while listing benefits
4. **CTA (30 sec):** "Here's what I want you to do next" - Three simple steps, repeat one.ie
5. **Optional Close (20 sec):** Handle the "why free?" objection and reinforce CTA

**Tone:** Direct, confident, conversational (like Frank - no hype, just facts and demo)

**Frank Kern Principles Applied:**
- SHOW the transformation, don't TELL about features
- Address objections proactively while listing benefits
- Make the CTA crystal clear and actionable
- Let the demo do the heavy lifting
- No technical jargon during the demo

## Key Soundbites (for social/clips)

### Frank Kern Style (Benefits-Focused)
- "The only thing between you and a live production app is 3 minutes and one.ie"
- "100% free forever. Not a trial. FOREVER."
- "This is live. This is production. This loaded in under 1 second anywhere in the world."
- "The page we just built? That's production code. You could start selling right now."
- "No credit card. No trial period. No 'upgrade to unlock features.'"
- "Once you see how fast you can build with this, you're never going back."
- "We're not giving it away to be nice. We're giving it away because you'll never leave."

### Technical Credibility
- "Cloudflare's edge network - 360 global locations"
- "100% Google Lighthouse score. Zero configuration."
- "Same infrastructure protecting Fortune 500 companies"
- "Scale from 2 users to 8 billion without refactoring"

## Demo Flow (for screen recording - Frank Kern Style)

### The ONE Demo (2-3 minutes total, ONE TAKE)

**CRITICAL: Record this in ONE UNINTERRUPTED TAKE showing the ENTIRE process**

1. **Open chat interface** (5 seconds)
   - Show blank screen/chat
   - "Watch this"

2. **Type the prompt** (10 seconds)
   ```
   Create a page selling the top 10 coolest products
   I'll buy when I'm a billionaire.

   Search the web for products, images, logos, pricing.
   Build product gallery with Stripe checkout.
   Mobile responsive. Deploy to Cloudflare.
   ```

3. **Show AI processing** (30 seconds)
   - Real-time: searching web
   - Real-time: finding images
   - Real-time: generating page
   - Real-time: setting up Stripe
   - Real-time: deploying

4. **Show the result** (40 seconds)
   - Open live URL immediately
   - Desktop view (smooth scroll through page)
   - Pull out phone, show mobile view
   - Click product, show Stripe checkout modal
   - Show Lighthouse score: 100/100
   - Show load time: <1 second
   - Show deployed URL

5. **The kicker** (15 seconds)
   - Split screen: your chat prompt vs. the live site
   - "2 minutes from plain English to live production site"
   - "100% free forever"
   - Show one.ie prominently

**What NOT to do (Frank Kern principles):**
- Don't explain features during the demo - let it speak for itself
- Don't stop to talk about the technology - show don't tell
- Don't show code unless it's auto-generated (and then briefly)
- Don't use technical jargon during the demo
- Don't apologize or hedge ("this usually works...")
- Don't have multiple cuts - ONE continuous demo = more credible

**What TO do:**
- Let silence work for you during processing/loading
- Show real metrics (Lighthouse, load time, live URL)
- Pull out phone for mobile demo (physical proof)
- Keep energy consistent but not hyped
- Pause after the reveal to let it sink in

## Implementation Notes

**Recording Setup:**
- Screen recording: 1920x1080 minimum
- Phone screen recording: Use QuickTime or AirPlay
- Audio: Clear voiceover (consider Frank Kern's casual but confident tone)
- Background music: Subtle, upbeat, don't overpower voice
- Editing: Minimal cuts during demo (ONE TAKE is best)

**Frank Kern Tone Guide:**
- Conversational (like explaining to a friend)
- Confident but not cocky
- No hyperbole ("amazing", "revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Facts and demo speak for themselves
- Address viewer skepticism directly
- Make CTA feel like helpful advice, not a pitch

**Testing Before Recording:**
- Ensure demo works flawlessly
- Practice timing (90 seconds for full demo)
- Test on slow connection (still fast?)
- Have backup examples ready
- Check all links work

**Key Message:**
"From plain English to production in minutes. 100% free forever. Start at one.ie"
