# Video Script: ONE Platform Demo
## Frank Kern Framework Applied

### Preparation Notes
- **Desired Outcome:** Get viewers to visit one.ie and start building
- **Benefits:** Free forever, fast deployment, no coding required, enterprise-ready
- **Objections:** "Too good to be true", "Probably limited features", "Will it scale?", "Is it actually free?"

---

## Opening Hook (15 seconds)
### "Here's What I Got"

"I'm going to show you how to build and deploy a production-ready e-commerce site in the next 3 minutes.

No coding. No configuration hell. No credit card.

Just plain English, and it's live on Cloudflare's global edge network.

Watch this."


---

## Part 1: DEMO - Show Don't Tell (90 seconds)
### "Here's What I Got" (Continued)

**[SCREEN RECORDING STARTS]**

"I'm going to type in plain English what I want:

```
Create a page selling the top 10 coolest products
I'll buy when I'm a billionaire.

Search the web for:
- Product names and descriptions
- Product images
- Company logos and icons
- Pricing

Build a product gallery page with:
- Hero section
- Product grid with images
- Mobile responsive
- Deploy to Cloudflare
```

**[Show AI processing]**

The system just:
- Searched the web for billionaire products
- Found images, logos, pricing
- Generated a production-ready page
- Deployed to 360 global locations

Time elapsed: 2 minutes.

**[Show live site on phone and desktop]**

This is live. This is production. This loads in under 1 second anywhere in the world.

100% Lighthouse score. Zero configuration."

---

## Part 2: What It'll Do For You (60 seconds)
### "Here's What It'll Do For You"

**Address objections while showing benefits:**

"Now you're probably thinking: 'This can't be free. There's gotta be a catch.'

There's no catch.

**What you get:**
- 100% free forever (not a trial - FOREVER)
- You own your code
- Free Cloudflare hosting (360 global edge locations)
- Free SSL certificates
- Unlimited pages
- Unlimited products
- Sub-second page loads globally
- 100% Google Lighthouse scores
- Production-ready code (Astro 5, React 19, Tailwind v4)

**'But will it scale?'**

It's built on the same infrastructure that handles millions of requests:
- Cloudflare's edge network (the same one protecting Fortune 500 companies)
- Use any backend. Real-time database with Convex
- The 6-dimension ontology that scales from 2 users to 8 billion without refactoring

**'What can I actually build?'**

Anything:
- E-commerce stores (with Stripe, we just showed you)
- Course platforms with enrollments
- SaaS landing pages with pricing tiers
- Community platforms
- AI agent apps
- Blogs, portfolios, documentation sites

All with the same simple approach: describe what you want, paste it in chat, deploy.

**'Is this actually production-ready?'**

The page we just built? That's production code. You could start selling products right now. Just add your real Stripe keys."

---

## Part 3: What I Want You To Do Next (30 seconds)
### "Here's What I Want You To Do Next"

"Here's what I want you to do:

**Step 1:** Go to **one.ie** right now

**Step 2:** Type what you want to build in plain English (just like I showed you)

**Step 3:** Watch it build and deploy

That's it.

No credit card. No trial period. No 'upgrade to unlock features.'

**100% free forever.**

If you want to sell something? Add your Stripe keys and you're live.

If you want AI chat? Tell it to add chat.

If you need it to scale? It already does.

**The only thing standing between you and a live production app is 3 minutes and one.ie**

So go build something."

---

## Part 4: Social Proof & Final Objection Handling (Optional - 20 seconds)

"'Why are you giving this away for free?'

Because the real magic isn't in the code - it's in the 6-dimension ontology underneath.

Once you start building on ONE, you'll realize you can build ANYTHING without changing your schema.

Need to add team features? Same schema.
Want to add courses? Same schema.
Scale to millions of users? Same schema.

We're not giving away the platform to be nice. We're giving it away because once you see how fast you can build with this, you're never going back to the old way.

**one.ie** - go build."

## Video Structure Summary (Frank Kern Framework)

**Total Length:** 3-4 minutes

1. **Hook (15 sec):** "Here's what I got" - Promise to show production deployment in 3 minutes
2. **Demo (90 sec):** "Here's what I got" - SHOW the entire process, no talking about features
3. **Benefits (60 sec):** "Here's what it'll do for you" - Address all objections while listing benefits
4. **CTA (30 sec):** "Here's what I want you to do next" - Three simple steps, repeat one.ie
5. **Optional Close (20 sec):** Handle the "why free?" objection and reinforce CTA

**Tone:** Direct, confident, conversational (like Frank - no hype, just facts and demo)
