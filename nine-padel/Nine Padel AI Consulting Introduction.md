Hi Warren, 

I've sent along an **AI Opportunities document** — it shows _what’s possible_:  

I'd like to provide Nine Padel with consulting to show you **how** exactly to make that vision real.

It starts by capturing **how your business actually thinks** — how your products, customers, and decisions connect.  This will be the foundation every AI agent, campaign, and automation will depend on.  It's what we will call your **Intelligence Architecture.**

I have attached a proposed consulting engagement builds that brain, defines the customer journey, models the marketing and sales logic, and maps the technology roadmap that makes it executable.

It will take a month to complete. By the end of the month, you’ll own:

- **The Brain** — your Intelligence Architecture
    
- **The Playbook** — your journey, messaging, and prompts
    
- **The Logic** — marketing, sales, and service reasoning
    
- **The Roadmap** — your path to intelligent, agentic commerce
    
**Investment:** £4,000 
**Duration:** 1 Month  
**Deliverable:** Complete AI Intelligence Architecture, Playbook, AI Agent Logic and Technology Roadmap for Nine Padel
