# /plan - Convert Ideas to Implementation Plans with CASCADE

**Purpose:** Transform ideas into detailed 100-inference plans with automatic agent assignment and task breakdown.

## Core Functionality

### Convert Idea to Full Plan

```bash
/plan convert "Build a course platform with AI tutors"
```

Generates:
- ✅ 100-inference execution plan
- ✅ Automatic agent assignments
- ✅ Task dependencies & timeline
- ✅ 6-dimension ontology mapping
- ✅ Quality loop workflow
- ✅ Estimated tokens & budget

## Quick Usage

### Plan Conversion (CASCADE Integration)

```bash
/plan convert [idea]                    # Convert idea to full plan
/plan show                              # Show current plan with assignments
/plan export [format]                   # Export plan (md, json, csv)
```

### Execution Management

```bash
/now                                    # Show current inference & task
/next                                   # Advance to next inference
/done                                   # Mark complete & advance
/goto [N]                              # Jump to inference N
```

### Plan Filtering & Analysis

```bash
/plan filter --agent=[name]            # Filter by agent (backend, frontend, etc)
/plan filter --dimension=[name]        # Filter by dimension (things, connections, etc)
/plan filter --status=[status]         # Filter by status (completed, pending, blocked)
/plan dependencies                      # Show task dependencies
/plan timeline                          # Show gantt-style timeline
/plan stats                             # Show plan statistics
```

## Example: Converting an Idea to a Plan

### Input

```
/plan convert "Build a course platform where creators can:
- Upload courses with lessons and quizzes
- Set up AI tutors that answer student questions
- Earn tokens that students can buy/trade
- Access analytics on student progress

💾 DEPENDENCIES & TIMELINE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Sequential (Cannot run in parallel):
  1-10 (Foundation) → All other phases

Parallel Tracks (Can run simultaneously after Foundation):
  Backend Track:   Cycle 11-20 → 41-50 → 51-60
  Frontend Track:  Cycle 21-30 → 61-70
  Design Track:    Cycle 21-30 → 31-40
  Quality Track:   Cycle 41-50 → 61-70 → 81-90
  Integration:     Cycle 71-80 (after backend + frontend core)

Critical Path:
  Foundation → Backend Schema → Mutations → Frontend Implementation
  (28 days minimum, parallelization can reduce)

  - Estimated duration: 90 days
  - Parallel tracks: 5
  - Quality loops: 4
```

### Export Plan

```bash
# Export to different formats

/plan share                              # Generate shareable link
```

## Plan Structure

Each plan includes:

### 1. Idea Validation
- Maps to 6-dimension ontology
- Identifies entity types
- Lists required connections
- Determines event types

### 2. 100-Inference Breakdown
- Foundation (Cycle 1-10)
- Backend (Cycle 11-50)
- Frontend (Cycle 21-80)
- Quality (Cycle 41-90)
- Operations (Cycle 91-100)

### 3. Agent Assignments
- Each agent gets specific cycles
- Skills listed for each task
- Dependencies documented

### 4. Quality Loop
- Tests defined before design/implementation
- Design created to satisfy tests
- Implementation validates against tests
- Failures trigger root cause analysis

### 5. Timeline & Dependencies
- Parallel work identified
- Critical path highlighted
- Gantt chart generated

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Convert Idea to Plan

```bash
/plan convert "Build an e-commerce store with product recommendations"

Output:
✅ Plan generated: 100 cycles
✅ Agents assigned: 15 specialists
✅ Quality loops: 3
✅ Dependencies: 24
```

### Example 2: View Plan with Agent Filter

```bash
/plan filter --agent=backend

Output:
Shows only backend cycles:
- Cycle 11-20: Schema design
- Cycle 41-50: Queries
- Cycle 51-60: Mutations
```

### Example 3: Export and Share

```bash
/plan export markdown

Output:
📄 Created: one/plans/ecommerce-store.md
📊 Statistics: 100 cycles, 15 agents, 90 days
🔗 Share: /plan share
```

## Inference Workflow Integration

Once plan is created, use these commands:

```bash
/now                    # Show current inference (Cycle 1)
/next                   # Advance to next inference
/done                   # Mark complete, capture lessons
/goto [N]              # Jump to specific inference
/build                 # Start building with agents
```

## Key Principles

1. **Ideas → Plans:** Convert any idea into actionable 100-inference plan
2. **Automatic Assignment:** Agent assignments happen automatically based on inference type
3. **Quality First:** Tests defined before implementation
4. **Parallel Execution:** Maximize agent parallelization
5. **Complete Tracking:** Every inference tracked with status, dependencies, lessons
6. **Continuous Learning:** Capture lessons after each inference
