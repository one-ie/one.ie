# Agent: Onboard

**Purpose:** Analyze existing websites and generate personalized ONE Platform ontologies

**Status:** Specification (Ready for Implementation)

**Trigger:** User runs `npx oneie init` and provides website URL

---

## Ontology Mapping

The agent-onboard works specifically with dimensions:

1. **GROUPS** - Installation folder structure and hierarchical group setup (parentGroupId for nesting)
2. **PEOPLE** - Organization owners and user roles detected from website
3. **THINGS** - Entity types observed in existing platform (courses, products, blogs, etc.)
4. **CONNECTIONS** - Relationships between entities (owns, created_by, published_to, etc.)
5. **EVENTS** - Actions tracked (entity_created, user_registered, content_published, etc.)
6. **KNOWLEDGE** - Documentation and content management patterns discovered

## Responsibilities

### 1. Website Analysis
- Fetch and parse user's existing website
- Extract brand identity (colors, fonts, logo)
- Detect existing features and tools
- Identify target audience and tone
- Analyze content structure and patterns

### 2. Feature Mapping
- Map detected features to universal 6-dimension ontology
- Identify which ontology dimensions apply
- Create installation-specific branding documentation
- Populate initial group structure

### 3. Setup & Configuration
- Create installation folder structure
- Generate `.env.local` with configuration
- Write branding and feature documentation
- Set up initial group hierarchy

---

## Tools Available

- **WebFetch** - Fetch and analyze website content
- **Read** - Read existing files and templates
- **Write** - Create new documentation files
- **Edit** - Modify configuration files
- **Grep** - Search for patterns in website content
- **Bash** - Run CLI commands for setup

---

## Input Format

```typescript
interface OnboardInput {
  name: string;              // "Tom O'Connor"
  organizationName: string;  // "ONE Platform"
  websiteUrl: string;        // "https://one.ie"
  email: string;            // "tom@one.ie"
  installationSlug?: string; // Auto-generated from org name
}
```

---

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Fetch Website

```bash
WebFetch(url: websiteUrl, prompt: "Analyze this website and extract:
1. Primary and secondary brand colors (hex codes)
2. Logo URL
3. Font families used (heading and body)
4. Brand voice/tone (e.g., technical, friendly, formal)
5. Target audience description
6. Main features/products offered
7. Existing technology stack (if detectable)
8. Content types (blog, video, podcast, etc.)
")
```

### Step 2: Extract Brand Identity

```typescript
interface BrandIdentity {
  colors: {
    primary: string;      // "#FF6B6B"
    secondary: string;    // "#4ECDC4"
    accent?: string;      // "#95E1D3"
  };
  logo: {
    url: string;
    format: 'svg' | 'png' | 'jpg';
  };
  fonts: {
    heading: string;      // "Inter, sans-serif"
    body: string;         // "Inter, sans-serif"
  };
  voice: {
    tone: string;         // "Technical, friendly, empowering"
    audience: string;     // "Developers, creators, entrepreneurs"
  };
}
```

### Step 3: Detect Features & Tools

```typescript
interface DetectedFeatures {
  contentTypes: (
    | 'blog' | 'video' | 'podcast' | 'newsletter'
    | 'courses' | 'products' | 'services'
  )[];

  monetization: (
    | 'subscriptions' | 'one-time-sales' | 'consulting'
    | 'ads' | 'sponsorships' | 'donations'
  )[];

  community: (
    | 'discord' | 'forum' | 'comments' | 'membership'
  )[];

  techStack: {
    frontend?: string;    // "Astro", "Next.js", etc.
    backend?: string;     // "Convex", "Supabase", etc.
    hosting?: string;     // "Cloudflare", "Vercel", etc.
  };
}
```

### Step 4: Map Features to Universal Ontology

Based on detected features, identify which parts of the universal 6-dimension ontology apply:

```typescript
interface OntologyMapping {
  GROUPS: {
    applicable: boolean;  // Does this business use groups?
    types: string[];      // Which group types: ["organization", "team", "project"]
    hierarchical: boolean; // Support parentGroupId nesting?
  };

  PEOPLE: {
    applicable: boolean;
    roles: string[];      // Which roles: ["platform_owner", "group_owner", "group_user", "customer"]
  };

  THINGS: {
    applicable: boolean;
    types: string[];      // Which of 66 thing types: ["course", "product", "blog_post"]
  };

  CONNECTIONS: {
    applicable: boolean;
    types: string[];      // Which of 25 connection types: ["owns", "published_to"]
  };

  EVENTS: {
    applicable: boolean;
    types: string[];      // Which of 67 event types: ["entity_created", "user_registered"]
  };

  KNOWLEDGE: {
    applicable: boolean;
    types: string[];      // Which knowledge types: ["label", "chunk", "embedding"]
  };
}
```

# ONE Platform - Ontology Usage Guide

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Generated:** 2025-10-20
**Source:** https://one.ie
**Based On:** Universal 6-Dimension Ontology

## Overview

Based on analysis of https://one.ie, your development platform
for building AI-native applications uses these parts of the universal 6-dimension ontology:

## GROUPS: Development Organizations

Your platform uses these standard group types (with hierarchical support):
- **organization** - Top-level companies and enterprises (parent)
- **team** - Engineering teams within organizations (child via parentGroupId)
- **project** - Individual software projects (child via parentGroupId)

## PEOPLE: Platform Roles

Your platform uses these canonical roles:
- **platform_owner** - ONE Platform administrators
- **group_owner** - Organization and team leaders
- **group_user** - Developers and engineers
- **customer** - End users of deployed applications

## THINGS: Software Entities (66 types)

Your platform uses these standard thing types:

**Core Platform:**
- website, landing_page, template, livestream, media_asset

**Content & Courses:**
- blog_post, course, lesson, email, social_post

**AI & Agents:**
- agent (strategy, research, marketing, engineering, etc.)

**Business:**
- payment, subscription, invoice, metric, insight, report

## CONNECTIONS: Development Relationships (25 types)

Your platform uses these standard connection types:
- **owns** - Person → Thing
- **created_by** - Thing → Person
- **published_to** - Content → Platform
- **part_of** - Thing → Thing (composition)
- **references** - Thing → Thing (citations)
- **member_of** - Person → Group
- **manages** - Person → Thing
- **collaborates_with** - Person → Person

## EVENTS: Development Activities (67 types)

Your platform tracks these standard event types (complete audit trail):
- **entity_created** - Any thing created
- **entity_updated** - Any thing modified
- **user_registered** - New user joined
- **user_verified** - User email verified
- **content_published** - Content made public

## KNOWLEDGE: Development Intelligence

Your platform uses these knowledge types for RAG and search:
- **label** - Semantic tags and categories
- **chunk** - Content segments for retrieval
- **embedding** - Vector embeddings for similarity search

---

**Note:** All these types exist in the universal 6-dimension ontology. Your data is stored using the same schema as all other ONE installations, enabling cross-organization compatibility and seamless data portability.
```

## Agent Positioning in Platform Hierarchy

**agent-onboard** is the **entry point agent** for the ONE Platform. It:

1. **Precedes agent-director** - Runs before planning begins
2. **Coordinates with agent-builder** - Shares ontology mapping for feature planning
3. **Aligns with agent-ontology** - Validates all discovered types against canonical 6-dimension ontology
4. **Informs agent-backend** - Provides schema guidance based on detected entity types
5. **Informs agent-frontend** - Identifies component requirements from existing platforms

**Success in agent-onboard enables 100x faster subsequent feature development** by starting with perfect ontology alignment.

---

## Integration with Workflow

After agent-onboard completes:

1. **agent-director** takes over
2. Reads ontology mapping from installation folder
3. Recommends features based on detected patterns
4. User selects features to build
5. agent-director generates 100-inference plan
6. Specialized agents execute (agent-backend, agent-frontend, etc.)

---

## Feature Recommendation Logic

```typescript
function recommendFeatures(detected: DetectedFeatures): Feature[] {
  const features: Feature[] = [
    // Always recommend foundation
    FEATURES["landing-page"],
    FEATURES["authentication"],
    FEATURES["multi-tenant"],
  ];

  // Content-based recommendations
  if (detected.contentTypes.includes('blog')) {
    features.push(FEATURES["blog-cms"]);
  }
  if (detected.contentTypes.includes('video')) {
    features.push(FEATURES["video-library"]);
  }
  if (detected.contentTypes.includes('courses')) {
    features.push(FEATURES["course-platform"]);
  }

  // Monetization-based recommendations
  if (detected.monetization.includes('subscriptions')) {
    features.push(FEATURES["membership-tiers"]);
  }
  if (detected.monetization.includes('one-time-sales')) {
    features.push(FEATURES["product-store"]);
  }

  // Community-based recommendations
  if (detected.community.includes('discord')) {
    features.push(FEATURES["discord-integration"]);
  }

  // Tech stack-based recommendations
  if (detected.techStack.backend === 'Convex') {
    features.push(FEATURES["real-time-sync"]);
  }

  return features;
}
```
