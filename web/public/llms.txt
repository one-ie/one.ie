# ONE Platform - llms.txt

> **For Large Language Models and AI Coding Assistants**

A multi-tenant AI-native platform built on a 6-dimension ontology that models reality through: Groups, People, Things, Connections, Events, and Knowledge.

ONE Platform is a complete web framework combining Astro 5, React 19, Tailwind v4, and Convex backend with a universal 6-dimension ontology. Simple enough for children, powerful enough for enterprises.

## 🚀 Quick Start for AI Agents

**IMPORTANT:** If you are an AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot), use the agent command:

```bash
# Zero-interaction setup (completes in 5-10 seconds)
npx oneie agent

# Automatic context detection from:
# - Claude Code environment (CLAUDE_CODE, CLAUDE_USER_NAME, CLAUDE_ORG_NAME)
# - Git configuration (user.name, user.email, remote.origin.url)
# - package.json (author, homepage)
# - README.md (first H1, URLs)
# - Directory structure

# What it creates:
# - /one/ (ontology, docs, specs)
# - /.claude/ (agents, commands, hooks)
# - /<org-slug>/ (installation folder)
# - .env.local (organization settings)
# - CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md
```

**With Claude context (passed automatically by Claude Code):**
```bash
npx oneie agent \
  --claude-user="Your Name" \
  --claude-email="your@email.com" \
  --claude-org="Your Organization"
```

**After setup, use Claude Code:**
```bash
claude                   # Start Claude Code
/one                     # Show control center
/chat [idea]             # Start conversation & onboard
/plan convert            # Create 100-cycle plan
/now                     # View current cycle
/create [feature]        # Build with specialists
/done                    # Complete cycle
/push                    # Commit & push
/deploy                  # Deploy to production
```

## The 6 Dimensions

Everything you build MUST map to these dimensions:

- [Groups](/one/knowledge/groups.md): Hierarchical containers (friend circles to governments)
- [People](/one/knowledge/people.md): Authorization and governance (4 roles)
- [Things](/one/knowledge/things.md): All entities (66+ types with flexible properties)
- [Connections](/one/knowledge/connections.md): Relationships between entities (25+ types)
- [Events](/one/knowledge/events.md): Actions and state changes (67+ event types)
- [Knowledge](/one/knowledge/knowledge.md): Embeddings and semantic search (RAG)

## Frontend-First Development (Default Mode)

**CRITICAL:** All agents default to frontend-only development unless explicitly requested otherwise.

**When building features:**
1. Build ONLY frontend code by default
2. Use client-side state management (nanostores)
3. Integrate third-party services via direct API calls (Stripe.js, OpenAI SDK)
4. Store data in browser (localStorage) or third-party services
5. NEVER create backend code unless explicitly requested

**Backend is ONLY needed when user explicitly says:**
- "Use backend"
- "Add groups" (multi-tenant data isolation)
- "Add multi-user" (user collaboration)
- "Track events" (immutable audit trail)
- "Build RAG" (vector embeddings)
- "Real-time updates" (WebSocket sync)

## Progressive Complexity (5 Layers)

Start simple, add layers only when needed:

**Layer 1: Content + Pages (80% of features)**
```astro
---
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";
const products = await getCollection("products");
---

<Layout>
  {products.map(product => (
    <ThingCard thing={product.data} type="product" />
  ))}
</Layout>
```

**Layer 2:** + Validation (Effect.ts services) - Only when you need validation
**Layer 3:** + State (Nanostores) - Only when islands need to communicate
**Layer 4:** + Multiple Sources (Provider pattern) - Only when switching content sources
**Layer 5:** + Backend (Convex) - Only when explicitly requested

**Golden Rule:** Start at Layer 1. Add layers only when you feel the pain.

## Pattern Convergence (98% AI Accuracy)

**ONE component per dimension** (not one per entity type):
- `ThingCard` - For ALL thing types (product, course, agent, etc.)
- `PersonCard` - For ALL people
- `EventItem` - For ALL events

**Result:** 98% AI accuracy (patterns converge, not diverge)

## Before Writing ANY Code

**CRITICAL READING:**

1. `CLAUDE.md` - Root instructions for Claude Code
2. `AGENTS.md` - Quick reference for Convex patterns
3. `/one/knowledge/ontology.md` - Complete 6-dimension spec
4. `/one/knowledge/astro-effect-simple-architecture.md` - Progressive complexity
5. `/one/knowledge/rules.md` - Golden rules for AI development

## Development Commands

```bash
bun run dev              # Start dev server (localhost:4321)
bun run build            # Build for production
bunx astro check         # Type checking
bun test                 # Run tests
```

## Key Principles

1. **Clarity Scales** - Everything maps to 6 dimensions
2. **Groups Partition** - Multi-tenant by design
3. **People Authorize** - Every action traces to human intent
4. **Things Exist** - 66 typed entities
5. **Connections Relate** - 25 relationship types
6. **Events Record** - Immutable audit trail
7. **Knowledge Learns** - AI understanding

## Performance

- **Setup time:** 5-10 seconds (agent mode) vs 2-3 minutes (interactive)
- **Pattern accuracy:** 98% (compound over time)
- **Core Web Vitals:** 90+ Lighthouse score
- **Scale:** 2 people → billions without schema changes

## Support

- Website: https://one.ie
- GitHub: https://github.com/one-ie/one
- Issues: https://github.com/one-ie/one/issues
- Discussions: https://github.com/one-ie/one/discussions
- CLI: `npx oneie agent --help`

## Agent Experience Philosophy

**"Agent Experience First"** - The CLI is designed so agents never get stuck on prompts they can't answer. If an agent accidentally runs the interactive command (`npx oneie`), it will:
1. Detect the agent environment
2. Show helpful error message
3. Suggest correct command: `npx oneie agent`
4. Exit cleanly without hanging

This ensures agents can automate project setup as part of natural conversation flow without manual intervention.
