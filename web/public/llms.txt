# ONE Platform

> A multi-tenant AI-native platform built on a 6-dimension ontology that models reality through: Groups, People, Things, Connections, Events, and Knowledge.

ONE Platform is a complete web framework combining Astro 5, React 19, Tailwind v4, and Convex backend with a universal 6-dimension ontology. Simple enough for children, powerful enough for enterprises.
