## The Tech (For Nerds)

**Stack**:

- **Astro 5.14+** - Static site generation + SSR
- **React 19** - Islands architecture, selective hydration
- **Convex** - Real-time database with typed functions
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Edge deployment with React 19 SSR
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - CSS-based configuration
- **shadcn/ui** - 50+ pre-installed components
- **Better Auth** - Multi-method authentication (6 methods)

**Philosophy**:

> Simple enough for children. Powerful enough for enterprises.

Everything is based on a **6-dimension ontology** (Groups, People, Things, Connections, Events, Knowledge) that scales from friend circles to global governments without schema changes.

**Architecture**:

```
Web (Astro + React) → Backend (Convex) → 6-Dimension Ontology
```
