# Release v3.4.2: Backend Independence & Connections Page

**Released**: October 18, 2025
**Type**: Patch Release
**Focus**: Architecture + UX

## What's New

### 🌐 New Connections Page

Visit https://one.ie/connections to explore the 6 open protocols that power ONE Platform:

1. **ACP** (Agent Communication Protocol) - REST-based messaging for AI agents
2. **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) - Universal connectivity for AI systems
3. **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent) - Framework-agnostic coordination
4. **AP2** (Agent Payments) - Autonomous transactions with verifiable credentials
5. **X402** (HTTP Payments) - Instant micropayments via HTTP 402
6. **AG-UI** (Agent-Generated UI) - Dynamic interfaces from structured JSON

**Features:**

- Interactive protocol cards with detailed specifications
- Real-world integration examples
- Multi-agent workflow demonstrations
- Code comparisons showing ontology mapping
- Mobile-responsive design

### 🏗️ Architecture: Backend Independence

**The Big Change**: Frontend no longer depends on Convex (or any specific backend).

**What This Means For You:**

- ✅ **Portability**: Frontend works with Convex, WordPress, Supabase, or any backend
- ✅ **No Lock-In**: Switch backends by changing ONE line of code
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: New backend? Just implement the DataProvider interface

**Before:**

```typescript
// Locked to Convex
import { api } from "convex";
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Works with ANY backend
import { useThings } from "@/hooks/useThings";
```

### 📚 Documentation Updates

**CLAUDE.md** now includes:

- ⚠️ **CRITICAL RULE** about backend separation
- Updated architecture diagrams showing 3-layer design
- Clear examples of FORBIDDEN vs CORRECT imports
- Data flow visualization

### 🛠️ Release Process Improvements

Enhanced `/release` command:

- ✅ Syncs `/web` to `/apps/one/web` via rsync
- ✅ Builds from production source
- ✅ Deploys to Cloudflare Pages automatically
- ✅ Works every time, predictably

## Breaking Changes

None. This release is fully backward compatible.

## Deprecations

- `src/lib/convex-api.ts` - Now a stub with helpful error messages
  - Use domain hooks instead: `useThings`, `useConnections`, `useEvents`
  - Will be removed in v4.0.0

## Installation

```bash
# Install latest CLI
npx oneie@latest

# Verify version
npx oneie@latest --version
# Should show: 3.4.2
```

## Live URLs

- **Web**: https://web.one.ie
- **npm**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/oneie
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/one-ie/cli/releases/tag/v3.4.2

## Performance Metrics

- **Build Time**: 28.24s (web application)
- **Deploy Time**: 2.21s (Cloudflare Pages)
- **Files Synced**: 552 to cli/, 552 to apps/one/
- **Total Duration**: ~10 minutes (pre-deployment to live)

## What's Next

### v3.4.3 (Next Patch)

- Complete removal of Convex-specific code from frontend
- Add WordPressProvider reference implementation
- Comprehensive DataProvider tests

### v3.5.0 (Next Minor)

- Multi-backend support (run Convex + WordPress simultaneously)
- CompositeProvider for request routing
- Provider performance monitoring

### v4.0.0 (Next Major)

- Remove all deprecated APIs
- Stable DataProvider interface
- Production-ready multi-backend support

## Migration Guide

### If You're Using `convex-api.ts`

**Old:**

```typescript
import { api } from "@/lib/convex-api";
const data = await convex.query(api.things.list, {});
```

**New:**

```typescript
import { useThings } from "@/hooks/useThings";
const { things } = useThings({ groupId, type });
```

### If You're Importing from Convex

**Old:**

```typescript
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
```

**New:**

```typescript
import { useThings } from "@/hooks/useThings";
// Backend-agnostic, works with any provider
```
