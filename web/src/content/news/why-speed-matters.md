# Why Speed Matters: ONE's Blazing-Fast Architecture

For enterprises serving millions or individuals launching their first startup, performance directly impacts:

- **User Experience**: 53% of users abandon sites that take > 3 seconds to load
- **SEO Rankings**: Google prioritizes fast sites in search results
- **Conversion Rates**: Every 100ms delay costs 1% in sales (Amazon)
- **Operating Costs**: Faster sites use less infrastructure

**Use Cloudflare**

---

## 🚀 Subsecond Loads. Every Single Time.

### The Numbers Don't Lie

```
Page Load:     < 330ms  (average)
Session Check: < 2ms    (cached)
API Response:  < 100ms  (edge)
Time to First Byte: < 50ms
First Contentful Paint: < 400ms
```

**How?**

### 1. Astro 5 + Islands Architecture

Traditional React apps ship **megabytes of JavaScript** to the browser. ONE uses **Astro's islands architecture**—only interactive components load JavaScript:

```
Traditional React App:  ~800KB JavaScript 📦
ONE Platform:           ~30KB JavaScript  🎯 (96% reduction!)
```

**What this means:**

- Static HTML loads instantly
- JavaScript only where needed
- Near-zero Time to Interactive
- Perfect for slow networks

### 2. Cloudflare Global Edge Network

ONE deploys to **Cloudflare Pages** with edge SSR:

- **330+ data centers** worldwide
- Serve content from the **closest location** to your users
- Average latency: **< 50ms globally**
- Automatic CDN for assets
- DDoS protection included

**Real-world example:**

- User in Tokyo → served from Tokyo (30ms)
- User in New York → served from New York (35ms)
- User in London → served from London (28ms)

No matter where your users are, they get **blazing-fast performance**.

### 3. React 19 Edge Rendering

ONE achieves the "impossible"—**React 19 SSR on Cloudflare Workers**:

```typescript
// Edge-compatible rendering
import { renderToReadableStream } from "react-dom/server.edge";

// Renders at the edge, not on a distant server
// Result: Subsecond page loads globally
```

**Why this matters:**

- HTML generated **at the edge** (milliseconds from user)
- Not generated in a single data center (hundreds of ms away)
- Streaming SSR for faster First Contentful Paint
- Progressive enhancement built-in
