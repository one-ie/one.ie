# Conversion Copy Quick Reference

**One-page cheat sheet for writing feature page copy that converts.**

For full templates and examples, see [Conversion Copy Patterns](/docs/conversion-copy-patterns).

---

## Headline Formulas (Pick One)

```
1. "[Result] in [Time]. [Social Proof]."
   Example: "Ship authentication in 10 minutes. Trusted by 500+ platforms."

2. "The [superlative] [category] for [audience]."
   Example: "The fastest authentication system for multi-tenant SaaS."

3. "From [pain] to [outcome] in [timeframe]."
   Example: "From 6 months of auth work to 10 minutes of integration."

4. "[Pain]? [Feature] solves it."
   Example: "Users forgetting passwords? Magic links solve it."

5. "How to [outcome] without [objection]."
   Example: "How to ship authentication without becoming a security expert."
```

---

## Value Proposition Template

```
Feature: [What it is]
Benefit: [What it does for you]
Outcome: [Result you achieve]

Example:
Feature: Magic link passwordless authentication
Benefit: Users log in with one click - no password to remember
Outcome: 50% fewer support tickets, 95% login success rate
```

---

## Page Structure Checklist

```
✅ HERO
  - Headline (10 words max)
  - Subheadline (20 words max)
  - Value proposition (1 sentence)
  - Primary CTA + Secondary CTA
  - Social proof (logos, stats)

✅ PAIN SECTION (PAS)
  - Problem (2-3 sentences painting pain)
  - Agitate (compound the pain with costs)
  - Solution preview

✅ SOLUTION
  - 3-5 benefits with before/after/result
  - Each benefit shows transformation

✅ HOW IT WORKS
  - Technical explanation (accessible)
  - Code example
  - Why it's better

✅ SOCIAL PROOF
  - Testimonials (specific results)
  - Stats (usage, customers, growth)

✅ OBJECTIONS
  - Top 3-5 questions answered
  - Specific, credible responses

✅ RISK REVERSAL
  - Guarantee, free trial, SLA
  - Remove friction to yes

✅ FINAL CTA
  - Repeat primary CTA
  - Add urgency if applicable
```

## CTA Formulas

**Action-Focused:** "Start free trial"
**Benefit-Focused:** "Ship authentication today"
**Curiosity-Focused:** "See how it works"
**Time-Bounded:** "Build your MVP this weekend"
**Social Proof:** "Join 500+ platforms"

**Test all 5. Measure winner.**

---

## Benefit Writing Pattern

```
### Benefit: [Outcome-Focused Title]
**Before:** [Painful status quo]
**After:** [Transformed state]
**Result:** [Measurable improvement]

Example:
### Benefit: Ship Today, Not in 6 Months
**Before:** 3 engineers, 6 months, questionable security
**After:** 1 developer, 10 minutes, battle-tested system
**Result:** Launch 6 months earlier. Build features instead of infrastructure.
```

---

## Objection Handling Template

```
**"[Common objection/question]"**

[Direct answer with specifics]

[Code example or proof if applicable]

[Social proof or case study]

Example:
**"How is this different from Auth0?"**

Auth0 is great for enterprises. Where ONE Auth wins:
- 70% cheaper at scale ($149/mo vs $1,400/mo for 10K users)
- No third-party redirects (stays on your domain)
- Multi-tenant by default (Auth0 requires config)

## Social Proof Formats

**Testimonial:**
```
> "[Specific result] in [timeframe]. [Feature] is [superlative]."
> — [Name], [Title] at [Company]
```

**Stats:**
```
By the numbers:
- [Metric 1]: [Impressive number]
- [Metric 2]: [Impressive number]
- [Metric 3]: [Impressive number]
```

**Before/After:**
```
**Before [Feature]:** [Pain]
**After [Feature]:** [Outcome]
> "[Quote about transformation]"
> — [Name], [Company]
```

---

## Urgency Triggers (Use Ethically)

**Time-Based:**
```
⏰ [Offer] expires in [countdown]
Lock in [benefit] before [date]
```

**Quantity-Based:**
```
[Number] of [Total] spots remaining
[Progress bar visualization]
```

**Social Proof:**
```
[Number] [people] [action] in the last [timeframe]
🔴 Live: [Name] just signed up
```

---

## Copy Style Rules

**DO:**
- Use "you" language (not "users")
- Write in active voice
- Be specific (numbers, timeframes)
- Show before/after transformations
- Quantify outcomes
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Add code examples for credibility

**DON'T:**
- Use jargon without explanation
- Make vague claims ("best", "fastest" without proof)
- Write walls of text
- Focus on features instead of benefits
- Use passive voice
- Forget the CTA

---

## A/B Test Priority

**Test these first (highest impact):**

1. **Headline** (3 variations using formulas above)
2. **Primary CTA** (action vs. benefit vs. curiosity)
3. **Social proof placement** (above vs. below fold)
4. **Hero image/video** (demo vs. result vs. people)
5. **Pricing presentation** (monthly vs. annual default)

**Run for:** 2 weeks minimum, 1000+ visitors per variation

---

## Feature Status Templates

### Completed Features
**Goal:** Convert to paid/enterprise
**Headline:** "[Result] in [Time]. [Social Proof]."
**CTA:** "Start free trial" / "Request demo"
**Urgency:** Customer count, growth stats

### Beta Features
**Goal:** Convert to beta signup
**Headline:** "Be first. [Benefit]. [Scarcity]."
**CTA:** "Request beta access"
**Urgency:** Limited slots, countdown

### Planned Features
**Goal:** Convert to waitlist
**Headline:** "Coming soon. [Vision]. Help us build it."
**CTA:** "Join waitlist"
**Urgency:** Early access, founding pricing

---

## Psychological Triggers Checklist

Before publishing, verify you've included:

- [ ] **Specificity** (actual numbers, not "many")
- [ ] **Social proof** (customer count, usage stats)
- [ ] **Authority** (technical depth, certifications)
- [ ] **Scarcity** (if applicable, must be real)
- [ ] **Urgency** (time-bound or quantity-limited)
- [ ] **Reciprocity** (free trial, tools, guides)
- [ ] **Consistency** (aligns with brand voice)

---

## Conversion Optimization Quick Wins

**5-minute improvements:**

1. **Add specific numbers** to headline
   - Before: "Fast authentication"
   - After: "Ship authentication in 10 minutes"

2. **Change CTA from action to benefit**
   - Before: "Sign up"
   - After: "Start shipping faster"

3. **Add social proof to hero**
   - Add: "Trusted by 500+ platforms"

4. **Quantify benefits**
   - Before: "Save time"
   - After: "Save 10 hours/week"

5. **Add customer quote**
   - Result-focused testimonial with name/company

**Expected lift:** 15-30% increase in CTA clicks

---

## When to Use Each Framework

**PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution):**
Use when audience clearly feels pain and needs motivation.

**AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action):**
Use for full landing pages or long-form sales copy.

**BAB (Before-After-Bridge):**
Use when transformation is clear and dramatic.

**Features → Benefits → Outcomes:**
Use when translating technical features to business value.

---

## Emergency Fixes for Low-Converting Pages

**If conversion rate < 2%:**

1. **Headline test** - Run 3 formula variations
2. **Add social proof** to hero (above fold)
3. **Simplify CTA** - One primary action
4. **Add risk reversal** - Free trial, money-back guarantee
5. **Show the product** - Demo video or screenshots

**If conversion rate 2-5%:**

1. **Test CTA copy** (action vs. benefit)
2. **Add testimonials** with specific results
3. **Improve benefit copy** (before/after/result)
4. **Add urgency** (ethical scarcity)
5. **Strengthen guarantee**

**If conversion rate > 5%:**

You're doing well. Optimize:
1. Secondary CTAs
2. Related feature cross-sells
3. Pricing page optimization
4. Email follow-up sequences

## Copy Voice Guidelines

**ONE Platform brand voice:**
- **Authority** - Know your stuff. Zero fluff.
- **Warmth** - We're rooting for you.
- **Technical depth** - Respect intelligence.
- **Humor** - When appropriate, never forced.
- **Education** - Every piece teaches something.

**Think:** Wired + Ars Technica + Alex Hormozi

**Not:** Corporate buzzwords or hype
