# Introduction to ONE

Welcome to ONE - a comprehensive platform for building AI-native applications with a clean, scalable architecture.

## What is ONE?

ONE is an open-source platform designed to help you build intelligent applications using a 6-dimension ontology that models reality itself. It combines:

- **Modern Frontend**: Astro 5, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Powerful Backend**: Convex real-time database with typed functions
- **AI-Ready Architecture**: Built-in support for AI agents and intelligent features
- **Scalable Design**: From small projects to enterprise applications

## Key Features

### 6-Dimension Ontology

Everything in ONE maps to six fundamental dimensions:

1. **Groups** - Hierarchical containers for multi-tenancy
2. **People** - Authorization and governance
3. **Things** - Entities and domain models
4. **Connections** - Relationships between entities
5. **Events** - Complete audit trails
6. **Knowledge** - RAG and semantic search

### Progressive Complexity

Start simple and add complexity only when needed:

- **Layer 1**: Static content with Astro
- **Layer 2**: Add validation with Effect.ts
- **Layer 3**: Add state management with Nanostores
- **Layer 4**: Switch data sources with providers
- **Layer 5**: Add backend with Convex

## Quick Start

Getting started with ONE is straightforward:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/one-ie/web.git
cd web

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev
```
