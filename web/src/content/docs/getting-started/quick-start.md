# Quick Start Guide

Get your first ONE project running in just a few minutes and start building with the 6-dimension ontology.

## What is ONE?

ONE is a coherent model of reality built on a universal 6-dimension ontology:

- **Groups** - Hierarchical containers (friend circles → DAOs → governments)
- **People** - Authorization & governance (who can do what)
- **Things** - Every entity type (users, agents, products, courses, tokens)
- **Connections** - Every relationship (owns, follows, teaches, transacts)
- **Events** - Every action (created, purchased, viewed, completed)
- **Knowledge** - AI understanding (labels, embeddings, search)

Everything scales from a lemonade stand to a Fortune 500 company without schema changes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (or Bun 1.0+)
- Git
- A text editor

## Step 1: Create a New Project

```bash
# Option A: Using the ONE CLI
npx oneie

# Option B: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/one-ie/one.git
cd web
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun install

# Or using npm
npm install

# Or using pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Step 3: Start Development Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:4321`

## Step 4: Launch Claude Code
