## Component Demo

See conversion components in action.

<FeatureCTA
  title="Test CTA Component"
  description="This demonstrates the call-to-action component"
  primaryText="Get Started"
  primaryUrl="/signup"
/>

## Feature Comparison

<FeatureComparison
  title="ONE vs Others"
  rows={[
    { feature: "Setup Time", one: "5 min", competitor: "30+ min" },
    { feature: "Multi-Tenancy", one: "Built-in", competitor: "DIY" }
  ]}
/>

## Success!

If you can see the components above, MDX is working perfectly. Now you can:

1. Convert any feature from `.md` to `.mdx`
2. Import components at the top
3. Use them throughout your content
4. Measure conversion improvements
