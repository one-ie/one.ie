## Overview

The ONE Platform Authentication System provides enterprise-grade user authentication with six different methods. Users can sign up and sign in using email/password, OAuth social login, passwordless magic links, or two-factor authentication.

## Supported Methods

### 1. Email/Password
Traditional sign up with email and password. Password hashed with bcrypt, strength requirements enforced.

<CodePlayground
  title="Sign Up with Email/Password"
  description="Simple email/password authentication in 3 lines of code"
  examples={[
    {
      language: "typescript",
      label: "TypeScript",
      code: `import { authClient } from '@/lib/auth';

const result = await authClient.signUp({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'SecurePassword123!',
  name: 'John Doe'
});

if (result.error) {
  console.error(result.error.message);
} else {
  console.log('User created:', result.data.user);
}`
    },
    {
      language: "javascript",
      label: "JavaScript",
      code: `import { authClient } from '@/lib/auth';

const result = await authClient.signUp({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'SecurePassword123!',
  name: 'John Doe'
});

if (result.error) {
  console.error(result.error.message);
} else {
  console.log('User created:', result.data.user);
}`
    }
  ]}
/>

### 2. OAuth Social Login

One-click authentication with popular OAuth providers:

  ]}

<CodePlayground
  title="OAuth Sign In"
  description="Add social login in one line"
  examples={[
    {
      language: "typescript",
      label: "React Component",
      code: `import { authClient } from '@/lib/auth';

export function SocialLogin() {
  const handleGoogleSignIn = async () => {
    await authClient.signIn.social({
      provider: 'google',
      callbackURL: '/dashboard'
    });
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleGoogleSignIn}>
      Sign in with Google
    </button>
  );
}`
    }
  ]}
/>

### 3. Magic Link Passwordless

One-click email authentication. No password required, ultra-secure.

<CodePlayground
  title="Implement Magic Link"
  description="Send passwordless login links"
  examples={[
    {
      language: "typescript",
      label: "TypeScript",
      code: `import { authClient } from '@/lib/auth';

const result = await authClient.magicLink.send({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  callbackURL: '/dashboard'
});

if (result.success) {
  alert('Check your email for the magic link!');
}`
    }
  ]}
/>

### 4. Two-Factor Authentication

High-security login with additional verification:
- SMS verification codes
- Authenticator apps (TOTP)
- Backup codes

<CodePlayground
  title="Enable 2FA"
  description="Add two-factor authentication to user accounts"
  examples={[
    {
      language: "typescript",
      label: "Setup 2FA",
      code: `import { authClient } from '@/lib/auth';

// Enable 2FA for current user
const result = await authClient.twoFactor.enable({
  method: 'totp' // or 'sms'
});

// Returns QR code for authenticator app
console.log(result.data.qrCode);
console.log(result.data.backupCodes);`
    },
    {
      language: "typescript",
      label: "Verify 2FA",
      code: `import { authClient } from '@/lib/auth';

// Verify 2FA code during login
const result = await authClient.twoFactor.verify({
  code: '123456'
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log('2FA verified, user authenticated');
}`
    }
  ]}
/>

### 5. Email Verification

Verify email ownership during sign up. Can be required or optional per organization.

### 6. Password Reset

Secure account recovery via email with time-limited reset links.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

Each organization has isolated authentication:
- Separate user directories
- Per-organization password policies
- Custom OAuth providers
- Isolated session tokens

All scoped via `groupId` in the database.
