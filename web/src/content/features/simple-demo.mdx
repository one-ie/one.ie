import { FeatureCTA } from '../../components/features/mdx/FeatureCTA.tsx';

## Simple Demo

Testing if imports work with relative paths.

<FeatureCTA
  title="Does This Work?"
  description="Testing MDX component rendering"
  primaryText="Click Me"
  primaryUrl="#"
/>

If you see a button above, it's working!
