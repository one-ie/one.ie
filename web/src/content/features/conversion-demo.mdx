  type: 'product',
  name: 'Premium Course',
  properties: {
    price: 99,
    inventory: 100
  }
});

console.log('Product created:', product.id);`
    },
    {
      language: "javascript",
      code: `// Simple product listing
const products = await platform.things.list({
  type: 'product',
  status: 'published'
});

products.forEach(p => {
  console.log(p.name, p.properties.price);
});`
    }
  ]}
/>

## Conversion Psychology Mapping

Each component uses proven psychological triggers:

- **FeatureCTA** → Scarcity (limited beta) + Authority (social proof numbers)
- **PricingCalculator** → Consistency (personalized value = commitment)
- **SocialProof** → Social Proof (testimonials) + Authority (company logos)
- **CodePlayground** → Reciprocity (free value) + Authority (technical depth)
- **FeatureComparison** → Authority (quantifiable advantages)
- **FeatureDemo** → Liking (try before buy)

## Next Steps

1. Convert your feature pages from `.md` to `.mdx`
2. Import components at the top of the file
3. Embed components throughout content
4. Measure conversion lift (expect 20-40% increase in CTA clicks)

<FeatureCTA
  title="Start Optimizing Your Features"
  description="Use these components to turn feature pages into conversion machines"
  primaryText="View All Features"
  primaryUrl="/features"
  variant="gradient"
/>
